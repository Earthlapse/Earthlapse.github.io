  "body": "### Introduction\r\nOur team’s task is to design an interactive exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History which features CMU CREATE Lab’s Earth Timelapse software in a significant way. Since the exhibit will be situated in a high traffic, touch friendly area of the museum, it will specifically cater to interactions between children and their parents. In addition to making the Earthlapse software itself more user friendly, we are also assuming the responsibility of using the exhibit as a platform to deliver a message to the public about human impact, human ingenuity, and the decision points that face the next generation in regards to the future of our planet. The high level goal of our exhibit will be to turn user engagement with a powerful piece of technology into critical user engagement with the complexities of a topic like climate change.\r\n\r\n[Earth Timelapse Releases](https://github.com/Earthlapse/data-visualization-tools/releases)\r\n\r\n### Update History\r\n* [Earth Timelapse 2.0 (Exhibit Software Update): 4/21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byEQXTkcqDg) (branch:earthlapse-dev)\r\n* [Earth Timelapse Nightly: 4/20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yGmIk3Ptcg) (branch:earthlapse-stories)\r\n* [Earth Timelapse Nightly: 4/19 23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxFOtiWj5n8) (branch:earthlapse-stories)\r\n* [Earth Timelapse Nightly: 4/18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U2NUSgVPd4) (branch:earthlapse-stories)\r\n* [Earth Timelapse Nightly: 4/13 21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6NW2K9DK_k) (branch:earthlapse-stories)\r\n* [Earth Timelapse Nightly: 4/12 22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BCN9IZ08W8) (branch:earthlapse-stories)\r\n* [Earthlapse Nightly: 4/11 18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrYwj-yxuSw) (branch:earthlapse-stories)\r\n* [Earthlapse Nightly: 4/10 22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9tQdg8g0-0) (branch:earthlapse-stories-timelineanim)\r\n* Earthlapse for User Testing: 4/10 (branch:earthlapse-dev)\r\n* [Earthlapse Nightly: 4/9] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSejnRdDmdY) (branch:earthlapse-stories)\r\n* [Earthlapse Nightly: 4/8 21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IR6b3nBlFA) (branch:earthlapse-stories)\r\n* [Earthlapse 1.0 (Exhibit Software Update): 3/30 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3-1o-0ThqY) (branch:earthlapse-textbook)",
